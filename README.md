# GUI-BudgetWise

This project is a frontend-only recreation of a mobile app, developed as part of my GUI1 class. It leverages HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript to build out the various pages and design elements.

# Live Server
This project was made to be run by a server. Opening the HTML files locally will lead to incomplete pages. Please run the project locally using services like the Live Server extension in VSCode.

# Getting Started
## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```
## Run on a Local Server

As mentionned before, you need to run a local server for the pages to load correctly.
